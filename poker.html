													<h3>The Task</h3>
													<p> Poker is one of my favorite things to do outside of studying and working. It is one of my passions and I am always looking to learn more about strategy and learning more about the game as well as watching professional players excel at the game. As a result, I wanted to self learn iOS development, and attempt to implement my own poker bankroll tracker app. My goal is to be able to track and log sessions, report wins/losses and calculate the hourly of a player. The goal was to make an app that would work for both cash games and tournaments. Afterwards, I also wanted to try to implement pre-flop charts and equity calculators and possibly a hand simulator. This app is still currently under development, but a working prototype is finished locally. I hope to publish this app in the Spring of 2022.</p>

											<tr>
												<td style="vertical-align: top;">
													<h3> My Approach </h3>
													<ul>
														<li>Learn iOS Development. I completed Angela Yu's iOS Development Bootcamp on Udemy and practiced through the course projects.</li>
														<li>Sketch out implementation goals and features to implement.</li>
														<li>Phase 1: Implement basic functionality and testing locally. My outlined goals were to first develop session logging to input session data such as location, duration, winnings/losses, and any notes from the session. Additionally, I wanted functionality to filter out sessions by location and other bonus features.</li>
														<li>Phase 2: Improve UI design to be more colorful and flashy. Afterwards, start implementing features such as pre-flop charts, equity calculators, graphs, and possibly a hand simulator to display equity with simulated hands and cards left in deck.</li>

													<h3>Progress So Far</h3>
													<p>So far, I have completed my planned Phase 1 Implementation with features:
													<ul>	
														<li> Working prototype with live version on local iPhone </li>
														<li> Log and differentiate between cash and tournament sessions</li>
														<li> Visualize win/losses from each session</li>
														<li> Filter by location and session types</li>
														<li> Ability to start a timer at the start of the session, then end a session and log information</li>
														<li> Take and store notes specific to each session </li>
														<li> Customizability options with game variants, stakes, and location types</li>
														<li> Next Up: Phase 2 Implementation</li>
													</ul>
